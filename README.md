# StardewCollections
Are you ever trying to complete the Stardew Community Center or going for perfection but have a goldfish memory like me and hate having to open the menu constantly to check your progress or remember what you are on the hunt for? Keep this website open on a second monitor and use it to keep track of what you are working on.

## To Use
Just head to the website linked on the right and create a user! No email or any personal information needed. Just pick a username and password to save your progress to and you'll be good to go.

## How it works
Once you create a user and log in, you can choose your current goal (currently either the Community Center or everything from the collections tab, but let me know if you would like a different goal added).
Once you have chosen your goal, you arrive on the collections page. You can hover over each item to see the basic info, right click an item to add or remove it from your to do list (turns the button background green and makes some of the info stay on the text pane), or left click an item to mark it as completed. 
When you are done, you can click the save button and your progress is saved to the MongoDB database.
