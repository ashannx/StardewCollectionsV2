# StardewCollections
Are you ever trying to complete the Stardew Community Center or going for perfection but have a goldfish memory like we do? Do you hate having to open the menu constantly to check your progress or remember what you are on the hunt for? Make your life SO much easier and keep this website open on a second monitor (or tablet) and use it to keep track of what you are working on.

## Getting Started
Just head to the website linked on the right and create a user! No email or any personal information needed. Just pick a username and password to save your progress to and you'll be good to go.

## Tracking your Progress
Once you create a user and log in, you can choose your current goal (currently either the Community Center or everything from the collections tab, but let me know if you would like a different goal added).
Once you have chosen your goal, you arrive on the collections page. You can hover over each item to see the basic info, right click an item to add or remove it from your to do list (turns the button background green and makes some of the info stay on the text pane), or left click an item to mark it as completed.
When you are done, you can click the save button and your progress is saved to the MongoDB database.
On the fishing tab specifically, the different background colors refer to the weather the fish can be found in (blue=rain, yellow=sun).

## More info
This application works best on desktop, but can be done on tablet. You cannot use the right click or hover functions but clicking a button will bring up the info on the side (however, only one item at a time will show, you cannot create a list). On mobile, the text pane is gone completely, but the buttons still function to track your progress.
